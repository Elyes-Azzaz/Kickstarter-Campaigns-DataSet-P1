1	Project description

-The main objective of the project is to classify successful/failed projects on Kickstarter based on crawled database
-The application domain of the project is crowdfunding for creative and innovative projects. 
-The different types of data available in the Kickstarter database include information about projects such as:
 [title, description, category, amount requested, campaign duration, currency used, launch and end date of the campaign, number of contributors usw.
The data was collected by  Kaggle = ' https://www.kaggle.com/code/yaelgesser/kickstarter-projects-success-predictions/input '
and ‘web robot ‘. https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/


2	Data source and potential limitations:

There are potential data limitations including.
- the possibility of fraudulent projects. (Ex: a project that called twice)
-missing or incomplete information.
-differences in visibility, popularity number of contributors. (a project is very popular it does not mean that a good project)

3	Factors that influence the results.

The different factors that can influence the results of the project include:
-the project category : (film and video , music , art , technology….
-the amount requested (How much money does this project need.. 
-the campaign duration (How much time does the project take per day?
-the currency used (dollars or euro or pound……)
-the time of year (The right time of year for a successful project…
-the launching country 
-the number of contributors and the creator's previous success on Kickstarter.


4	Objectives of the project

The data can be used to train a classification model that will predict whether a project launched on Kickstarter is likely to succeed or fail.
For example, the model can analyze factors like the amount of money pledged, the category of the project, and the number of backers to decide about the success of the project.


5	Data cleaning and preprocessing.

The data will be cleaned and processed to remove missing values and to standardize the format of the data.



6	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA will be performed on the dataset to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationship between variables. This will help in identifying any patterns or trends in the data that may affect the model's performance.
